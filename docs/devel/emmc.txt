====================
eMMC block emulation
====================

Any eMMC devices has 3 kinds of partitions Boot, RPMB and User data. We
are supporting Boot and User data partitions. Boot area partitions are
expected to be 1MB size as hard coded in EXT_CSD register.

Below is the example of combining two 1MB bootarea partition and
user data partitions.

      cat mmc-bootarea0.bin mmc-bootarea1.bin  image.wic > mmc.img
      qemu-img resize mmc.img 4G

Note: mmc-bootarea0/1 are just raw paritions. User data can have
partition tables.
